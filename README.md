# Openwords Lesson Development

Scripts for generating lessons for the Openwords webapp are organized here.

The [Openwords Markup Language documentation](https://github.com/Openwords/OpenwordsWebapp/wiki/Openwords-Problem-Markup-Language-v0.2) is a simple, human readable text based language that represents exercises/problems in the Openwords webapp. Thus, scripts can be created that take input repositories of text and parallel texts and output various kinds of Openwords webapp exercises/problems.

Input sources can include various open repositories of language material including the [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) (an online multi-language dictionary), [Apertium](https://www.apertium.org/) (an online machine translator), or [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/) (a database of human generated single sentence translations in many languages).
